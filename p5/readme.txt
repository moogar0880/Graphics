Integrating certain elements into wxPython has added significant difficulty to completing all of the beta functionality. However, Demo1 - Demo4 all work correctly. Demo5 currently does not work, texture mapping seems to be pretty complicated and is poorly documented within wxPython. This will be a feature to be completed for the final version. There is also a bug which causes composite objects to not display correctly on occasion, this is also a bug that will be worked out before the final version.

The program can be run by running 'python main.py' from the command line

dependencies: PyOpenGL, wxPython
