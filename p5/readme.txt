All Demos and a PyOpenGL implementation of P2 are finished and working with the exception of the textureDemo (Demo5). This demo does not work due to complications with trying to integrate textures into a wx.OpenGLCanvas. I could find no documentation of this online and the bits and pieces which I did find required knowledge of several other 3rd party libraries to work. Even after significant time was spent attempting to get The Python Imaging Library (PIL), Pillow (A PIL wrapper), and the wx.Image class to work correctly I was still unable to get this demo working. This actually has me wondering if this demo is even possible within a wxPython OpenGLCanvas. However, all other demos and the P2 implementation work correctly.

The program can be run by running 'python main.py' from the command line

dependencies: PyOpenGL, wxPython
